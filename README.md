# Learning Python in the Hard Way

I was wanting to do this course for ages, but once I have received my [Google Foo Bar challange](https://twitter.com/Exadra37/status/790142290937442304), that can only be performed in Python or Java,
I decided that is finally time to take it and at same time try to complete the challange.

The official page for this course can be found in https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book.

## Exercises

### Exercise 0: The Setup

We will cover the setup of the environment as per https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html.

```bash
$ python --version
Python 2.7.8
```


### Exercise 1: A Good First Program

This [Exercise 1](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex1.html) is about learning how to use `print` in is most basic form.

### Exercise 2: Comments and Pounds Characters

On [Exercise 2](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex2.html) we will learn how comments works.


### Exercise 3: Numbers and Math

Learning on [Exercise 3](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex3.html) the symbols used by python to make math operations on numbers.


### Exercise 4: Variables and Names

Let's see in [Exercise 4](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex4.html) how Python deals with variables and their names.


### Exercise 5: More Variables and Printing

A more advance use of Variables with Print will be the focus on [Exercise 5](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex5.html) where we will learn how to put variables content inside a string.


### Exercise 6: Strings and Text

We have been using __Strings__ but they have not been formally introduced yet and [Exercise 6](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex6.html) will explain them and show some more complex use cases.
