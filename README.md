# Learning Python in the Hard Way

I was wanting to do this course for ages, but once I have received my [Google Foo Bar challange](https://twitter.com/Exadra37/status/790142290937442304), that can only be performed in Python or Java,
I decided that is finally time to take it and at same time try to complete the challange.

The official page for this course can be found in https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book.
