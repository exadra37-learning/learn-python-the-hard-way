# Learning Python in the Hard Way

I am to do this course for ages, but once I have receive my [Google Foo Bar challange](https://twitter.com/Exadra37/status/790142290937442304), that can only be performed in Python or Java, 
I decided that is finally time to take this course and at same time try to complete the challange.
